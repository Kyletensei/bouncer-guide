						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-12">
								<p>Through SEGA's "<strong>changes</strong>," the difference of weapon roles in Bouncer's repertoire has changed since Episode 3! 
								Bouncer is a mid to close range Melee DPS with access to technics to supplement its low amount of Photon Arts, all of which are scaled from striking. 
								With this in its arsenal, it has the second highest normal attack damage and all of its damage options boast gratuitous hitboxes as 
								both a big strength and weakness.</p>

									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Jet Boots Gear</strong></h5>
										What’s a weapon without its gear? Jet boots gear gives you access to a <strong>damage bonus of up to 15% for max gear</strong> across 
										your Photon Arts and normal attacks. The most important part of this is that it appeases your most commonly used stance considering 
										you can change your element on the fly by casting a technic of the corresponding element. This is the main way you’ll maintain gear. 
										<strong>Vinto and natural gear drain keeps elements!</strong>
									</div>

									<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="./assets/img/skill-icons/db-gear.png" alt="Dual Blades Gear icon">
									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Dual Blades Gear</strong></h5>
										What are Dual Blades without gear?! Wet noodles. Dual Blade Gear <strong>gives you access to a 
										damage bonus up to 20% for max gear across your Photon Arts and normal attacks</strong>. 
										The most important part is that now <strong>your gear can be expended to throw Photon Blades</strong>, 
										the most powerful tool Dual Blades have. Photon Blades are <strong>projectiles with slight homing 
										that can be thrown only when you have gear</strong> even during movement with the Weapon Action. 
										If you are to run into anything with the Weapon Action you also deal damage once to the first thing in your path. 
										The power notation ramps ridiculously with the corresponding ring. 
										Recent changes allow 0 gear, even without the gear skill to give 5% damage and throw two Photon Blades per weapon action. 
										<strong>Only one gear is expended during Weapon Action.</strong>
									</div>
								</div>

									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Jet Boots Gear Boost</strong></h5>
										The faster you can gain gear the faster you can use it! 
										There's no reason not to have this handy. 
										The <strong>increase in gear accumulation</strong> will keep your rotations	clean and fast with the right tools. 
										<strong>Accumulation from this skill caps at 150%.</strong>
									</div>

									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Rare Mastery Bouncer</strong></h5>
										This a primary bonus to get as it gives a <strong>1.1x damage multiplier for Jet Boots and Dual Blades.</strong>
									</div>

									<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="./assets/img/skill-icons/one-more-jump.png" alt="one more jump icon">
									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>One More Jump</strong></h5>
										As long as there’s a target and you have gear you can jump infinitely. 
										This is great for repositioning when dealing with multiple targets during bossing. 
										Can be performed while charging technics.
									</div>
								</div>
								
								<div class="media pt-2">
									<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="./assets/img/skill-icons/jb-escape.png" alt="Jet Boots escape Boost icon">
									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Jet Boots Escape</strong></h5>
										You don’t boss without a little utility to keep yourself alive and among them <strong>invincibility 
										frames during the Weapon Action of Photon Arts</strong> will make damage that might put you in harm's way a 
										little easier to perform. <strong>For some reason it still works outside of main class.</strong>
									</div>

									<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="./assets/img/skill-icons/epprf.png" alt="EPPRF icon">
									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Elemental PP Restorate Field</strong></h5>
										While Jet Boots get a lot of damage from their normal attacks you have to worry about management during 
										PA rotations with technics for upkeep. This field gives you an <strong>extra 3 pp per hit for hitting with the elemental 
										weakness</strong> on top of your natural on-hit recovery.
									</div>

									</div>
									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Shifta Air Attack Boost/Deband PP Restorate</strong></h5>
										As a Bouncer, as you’d imagine, you spend a fair amount of time attacking in the air and 
										the tree accommodates this. While Shifta boost is active you gain an additional <strong>5% damage while you’re in the air.</strong> 
										This is critical to your upkeep. Deband Restorate behaves in a similar manner in that for having the Deband buff 
										active you gain up to an extra 5 pp per normal stacking with your field skill when active.
									</div>

									</div>
									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Rapid Boost/Rapid JA Bonus</strong></h5>
										These two are skills a Jet Boot Bouncer can’t simply boss without. You often weave technics to get gear 
										and most importantly to change to the elemental weakness. Rapid Boost <strong>reduces charge time of Jet Boot PAs by up to 50% and 
										it reduces technic charge time by 15%</strong> as well. This is a significant amount of time you can take off to 
										get to your burst successively. Those normal hits will also get a <strong>15% attack boost</strong> during for having Rapid Boost JA Bonus. 
										<strong>The attack speed previously from Rapid Boost is now innate for JB.</strong>
									</div>

									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Switch Strike</strong></h5>
										Normally your damage will be scaled off T-ATK but dealt as striking. This makes Jet Boots damage and PAs scale from your S-ATK. 
										This is important since any <strong>meta combination</strong> that supports dual weapons <strong>scales best with S-ATK</strong>. 
										This is one of the most important parts of your tree and vital to have.

									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Photon Blade Fever (Up)/Photon Blade Escape</strong></h5>
										Here’s where photon blades vital damage source becomes ever more powerful. Photon Blade Fever is an active that <strong>doubles the amount of photon blades thrown</strong>. 
										The skills fever up <strong>increases the damage dealt by these blades by a whopping 30%</strong> while Photon Blade Escape adds invincibility time to 
										movement done while throwing photon blades by up to <strong>.35 seconds</strong> because what’s going to stand still and just let you beat them up?

									<div class="media-body">
										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Elemental Stance/Stance Up</strong></h5>
										This is your main multiplier as a Bouncer. Stances are actives that are permanent once activated. 
										You can only have one stance active at a time from a single class. 
										Elemental Stance gives you <strong>20% damage for hitting with an enemy’s elemental weakness, 
										gaining an additional 10% from the Stance Up passive skill</strong>. 
										This is compared to getting <b>half</b> as much without elemental weakness 
										since the <strong>non-weak element boost is only 15% total</strong>.

										<h5 class="mt-0"><strong>Break Stance/Stance Up/Break SD Bonus</strong></h5>
										This stance gains a damage multiplier based on a really simple concept, does it break? 
										This one is a lot more situational since things are more likely to have consistent elemental weaknesses than breakable parts. 
										<strong>Damage to breakable parts is increased by 35% with an additional 10% from Stance Up</strong>. Break SD Bonus uses the base Break Stance multiplier for scaling. 
										Break Stance D-Bonus adds a <strong>90% bonus to non-breakable parts for Dual Blades only. Unaffected by Stance Up/Stance Critical</strong>.

										The skill is self-explanatory, it allows others to <strong>keep the effects of the field skills

										These skills can <strong>remove the downtime</strong> of fields entirely as the buff remains for <b>30</b> seconds after CD.

										Critical hits are the <b>maximum</b> amount of damage an attack can deal <strong>before multipliers are calculated</strong> due to damage variance placing

								<p>Bouncer has two weapons that, in play, are interchangeable. These two weapons are Dual Blades and Jet Boots. 
								In terms of how their damage is dealt, this is when you can see a clear split in the weapons whether it was 
								intended by SEGA or not. Jet boots are a better weapon for burst as dual blades excels in sustain. 
								However, meta builds ideally utilize both. Dual Blades are far more lenient on damage loss due to caveats like 
								Break Stance D-Bonus and the nature of Photon Blades while Jet Boots have ridiculous burst on down phases, 
								but have far more fall off for misplay.</p>
								
								
								
								<h5 class="mt-2">
									<img class="mr-3 img-fluid" width="32px" src="./assets/img/db-custom-icon.png"> 
									<strong>Dual Blades (Soaring Blades), The Mobile Multi-Hit Monster</strong>
								</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Dual Blades are a weapon whose main gimmick is its ability to throw projectiles 
										called photon blades by using its gear gauge via Weapon Action.
									</li>
									<li>
										Photon Blades normally have weak homing that can be increased via a ring. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Most dual blade photon arts are <b>multi-hit</b> and primary use isn’t damage but to regain its gear 
										quite quickly to get back to photon blades which is the best source of damage while 
										in Photon Blade Fever. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Photon Blade Fever (PBF) has a 120 second cooldown and an active time of up to 45 seconds. 
										Considered to be the window of downtime since your best tool is at half of 
										its damage capability during cooldown.
									</li>
									<li>
										During this cooldown, Dual Blade PAs such as <strong>crafted Kestrel Rampage</strong> and 
										<strong>Immortal Dove</strong> are some of the best ways to maintain your DPS.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Kestrel Rampage Type-0</strong> is consistent damage ticks for a significant amount of damage in trade 
										for spending all your gear. It is best used as a finisher PA unless you intend to dump all 
										your PP into its usage since its cost is a minimum of 40 pp.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>DB Snatch</strong> is also a good source of damage as well as defensive mechanic that allows 
										you to reposition and damage anything you Weapon Action into while moving in a direction with 
										dual blades. This uses all your gear as well.
									</li>
								</ul>
							
								<h5 class="mt-2">
									<img class="mr-3 img-fluid" width="32px" src="./assets/img/jb-custom-icon.png"> 
									<strong>Jet Boots, Quick Kicks and Heavy Hits</strong>
								</h5>
								
								<ul>
									<li>
										Jet Boots main gimmick is the ability to change elements on the fly. 
										So they’re <strong>naturally a "rainbow" weapon set 6 in 1</strong>.
									</li>
									<li>
										Jet Boots Photon Arts hit for a lot less and have <strong>higher power 
										notations</strong> than Dual Blades Photon Arts, allowing for instant burst 
										in short phases.
									</li>
									<li>
										Rapid Boost cooldown is 120 seconds and has an uptime of 45 seconds. 
										Though Rapid Boost lowers charge time of PAs and technics by 15% and also increases 
										attack speed that much as well as Just Attack damage by just as much. 
										<strong>Jet Boots are capable of getting the same effects permanently from rings</strong> that stacks 
										on top of this while active meaning JB users have virtually <strong>no downtime!</strong>
									</li>
									<li>
										Jet Boot Normal Attacks have the <strong>second highest power notation in game as far as normals go</strong>. 
										Even without PP you can <strong>output damage that can rival but not beat your Photon Art rotation</strong>.
									</li>
									<li>
										Jet Boot Weapon Action is evasive movements with 3 spammable actions before a short pause. 
										Weapon Action used by during movement is briefly invincible before dealing damage. 
										<strong>None of this costs gear!</strong>
									</li>
									<li>
										Jet Boot Weapon Action during Jet Boot Photon Arts causes them to change behavior and power notation. 
										These behavioral changes are casting support technics while dealing damage or gaining a sufficient 
										amount of iframes that you can cancel out of.
									</li>
									<li>
										Vinto Gigue (Jetsweep Kick) is the <strong>highest hitting Photon Art Jet Boots have</strong>. Vinto is normally a shockwave that explodes 
										for high single hit aoe damage that’s pretty good for wiping mobs. The weapon action changes this into a 
										short range kick that does a ridiculous amount of damage. Since the last update Vinto no longer resets 
										element when gear is expended.
									</li>
									<li>
										Recent updates increased the power notation of the Jet Boot Photon Art Gran Wave (Grand Wave). 
										The <strong>damage dealt when point blank is increased</strong> as well!
									</li>
									<li>
										The craftable version of the Jet Boot PA Strike Gust <strong>increases in power by 1.5x past 7th rotation and onward</strong>. 
										Considering the <strong>gratuitous hitbox size</strong> this can make for some ridiculous sustained DPS.
									</li>

									<p>The height of Bouncer metagame. Phantom Sub offers utility for better Attack PP Restorate and gear generation bonuses 
									<b>(1.5x from Full Drive and 1.5x from Jet Boot Gear Boost)</b> allowing the <b>complete removal of the rigid DPS drop from PBF or Rapid Boost on cooldown.</b> 
									Aside from absolutely no downtime, BoPh has the <b>highest base crit rate</b> of any variation due to Photon Stream giving feasibly up to 40-50% based on 
									maximum PP as well as 5% crit damage while breaking <u>200 PP minimum</u> gives 10% damage as well. Phantom Short Charge also allows for the <b>50% cast time 
									and 30% cost reduction</b> making damage technics in your rotations fairly instant in turn for a <b>30% damage penalty</b> mitigated by spam possibility. 
									Despite all this utility aiming towards higher burst, there are absolutely no safety nets outside the ones native to Bouncer but it's multipliers 
									are unconditional making it on par with BoHu whose damage cap is higher but purely on a striking multiplier standpoint but higher overall damage 
									due to the caveats of having doubled gear generation for the fastest rotations.</p>

									<p>Etoile sub offers a lot of utility that’s unfortunately already native to the Bouncer tree. 
									Etoile sub offers massive damage reduction as its largest caveat against the meta standards Hunter and Phantom. 
									Its multipliers would be great if Bouncer actually needed the PP reduction on PAs from Tech Arts Count Bonus or the multiplier 
									actually worked for Technics. If you invest into Damage Balancer for bulk, you actually have to land during rotations since all healing 
									is reduced to 1 outside of -mates and a Bouncer should have no reason to be grounded that long over maintaining Shifta Air for output you

									<small>(Phantom Sub but with like 100% more DMC)</small>
									<p>Multiplier-wise, it's competitive with BoPh over the course of <b><u>long combat scenarios</u></b>. 
									The Voltage mechanic is key to <b><u>CD reduction, PP cost reduction, 25% crit rate, 20% damage reduction, auto status cleanse/immunity, 
									10% damage, and 150% active/passive PP regen.</u></b></p> 
									
									<p>Voltage is maintained through hitting any enemy and boosted against bosses with a <b><u>5 
									second complete decay</u></b> capping off at <b>500</b> which is considered <b><u><i>High Voltage cap</i></u></b> all the effects above. Using major CDs <b><u>before reaching 
									High Voltage results in near instant Rapid Boost/PBF cooldowns 50% reduction if used afterwards</u></b>.</p>
									
									<p>This is insanely powerful but the build up requires a reset from zero if there is any lull in combat (including cutscenes and area changes) 
									for more than five seconds. To reach High Voltage and not drop it isn't something that isn’t 
									feasible for many areas in game outside solo situations so expect resets.</p>
									
									<p>Thankfully the <b>high hit rate</b> for Bouncer weapons makes the Voltage build relatively painless.  
									Overall it's rotations are identical to that of Phantom sub but <b>Ramegid-0 becomes integral to rush to High Voltage</b>.</p>
									
									<p>Voltage resets have a <b>severe impact</b> on the consistency. Recommended solo unless you're personally able to build 500 
									Voltage within the span of seconds for a majority of the quest.</p>
									
									<p>The potential of its flexibility through CD reductions and High 	Voltage makes for infinitely higher DPS ceilings 
									and a complete freedom in PBF/RB rotations. Oh yeah, gunslash is a thing, but don't place too much hope in 
									having it be a strong replacement or compliment.</p>

											<small class="small-italic">Similar base attack to Stil with a 12% unconditional damage, 20% PP cost reduction every 10 seconds. 
											Stronger than Stil's minimum. Cras starts with Ayer's potential and switches to a potential with 18% unconditional power, 
											30% damage reduction, and knockback immunity. 30 second recast period.</small>
																					
											<p>The stone required to upgrade to Cras at current is limited to <b><u>one</u></b> and it’s <u>highly recommended</u> you upgrade the DB first over 
											the JB as high end total attack values will still damage cap on Serpen Plenzer/Ayer. Ayer will have the second highest base you can use so 
											it’s <b><i>recommended you pick up one for CPA damage, normal 3 triple hit glitch, and swap glitch</i></b>.</p>
